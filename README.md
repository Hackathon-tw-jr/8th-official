# 8th-official
Official Webpage for 8th Hackathon.Jr held in Mingdao High School (2022). This is the official site used for marketing and promotional material.
The webpage differs from previous iterations of Hack.Jr websites, being created using `npm` and `tailwindcss`, and uses modern web technologies as a better demonstration of what the competition is all about.

## Deploying Website
Loading the site itself is simple and straightforward.
1. Clone the repository using the SSH or HTTP methods.
2. Open `src/app.html` with the *Live Server* extension of VS Code

Alternatively, you can view this using Github pages. 


## Development
Developing the website itself involves conventions stated by Tailwind themselves. You have to use the node package manager in order to accomplish this.
